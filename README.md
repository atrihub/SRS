# SRS: Subject Randomization System

This is a version of the SRS: Subject Randomization System `R` package authored by Balasubramanian Narasimhan at Stanford which forked from [r-forge.r-project.org](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=539) on August 27, 2013 and modified to accomodate randomization for biomarker assays. See the vignette [constrained_randomization.pdf](https://github.com/atrihub/SRS/blob/master/inst/doc/constrained_randomization.pdf) for details.
